# ML2 Project

This repository contains the `ML2.ipynb` notebook, which demonstrates various aspects of data analysis and machine learning. The project is structured to showcase preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model-building workflows. Below, you'll find details about the contents, dependencies, and usage instructions.

## Contents

### Notebook
- **ML2.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing code and explanations for data processing and machine learning tasks. The notebook includes the following sections:
  1. **Data Loading**: Importing and preparing the dataset.
  2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding the data.
  3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones.
  4. **Model Training**: Building and evaluating machine learning models.
  5. **Results Analysis**: Analyzing the performance of the trained models.
